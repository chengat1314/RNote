#+TITLE:       A Few Buffer-Related Functions.

* ERRATA:

** find-tags function should be find-tag in emacs 24.

* A greate function definition resource is to using describe-functions and describe-variables..

* SOLUTIONS to exercises:
1. Write your own simplified-end-of-buffer function definition; then test it to see whether it works.
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes

(defun simplified-end-of-buffer()
  "DOCSTRING"
  (interactive)
  (push-mark)
  (goto-char (point-max)))

(simplified-end-of-buffer)

   #+end_src
2. Use if and get-buffer to write a function that prints a message telling you whether a buffer exists.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(defun test-buffer-exists(buffer-name)
  "DOCSTRING"
  (interactive "B")
  (if (get-buffer buffer-name)
      (message "Buffer; %s exists." buffer-name)
    (message "Buffer: %s does not exists." buffer-name)))


(test-buffer-exists "*scratch*")

"Buffer; *scratch* exists."

(test-buffer-exists "*dd*")

"Buffer: *dd* does not exists."
  #+end_src   
3. Using find-tag, find the source for the copy-to-buffer function.
This answer I have written is not so correct, because I do not know how to test it right now. 
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
(find-tag "copy-to-buffer")
#+end_src

* code in chapter 4:
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes

(find-tag "abc")

(beginning-of-buffer)

(end-of-buffer)

(defun simplified-beginning-of-buffer()
  "Move point to the beginning of the buffer;
leave mark at previous position"
  (interactive)
    (push-mark)
    (goto-char (point-min)))


(simplified-beginning-of-buffer)

  #+end_src
