* clojure
** Package management of clj.
   any Clojure library that does something interesting is going to
   need some Java libraries beyond what the JDK provides.
** Java has only one established dependency management system, Maven
   Maven seems to work well for large organizations that can benefit
   from setting up their own, private repositories, but itâ€™s kind of
   a headache for the independent developer.
** Add REPL
   Add REPL session to all projects.
   =~/.lein/profiles.clj=
   #+begin_src clojure
{:user {:plugins [[lein-swank "1.4.4"]
                 [lein-pprint "1.1.1"]]}}
   #+end_src
