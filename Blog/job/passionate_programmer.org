如果我想和能让我进步的人在一起，就得成为他们中的一员，而在某个公司工作
或者在大学进修是无法让我走向卓越的。
我要做的是弄明白成为他们中的一员意味着什么，然后努力去做。


1. 风险收益平衡。
2. Both ends of the technology adoption curve might prove to be
   lucrative.
3. You can't afford to compete on price.
4. Exploit market imbalances.
5. Be the worst guy in every band you are in.
6. Now is the time to think about business domains you invest your
   time in.
7. Generalists are rare and precious.
8. Too many of us seem to believe that specializing in something
   simply means not knowing about other things.
