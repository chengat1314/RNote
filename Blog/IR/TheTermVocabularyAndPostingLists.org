#+TITLE:   The Term Vocabulary And Posting Lists

* Jargons
  1. Stop word:
     some extremely common words which would appear to be of little
     value in helping select documents matching a user need are
     excluded from the vocabulary entirely.
     The general strategy for determining a stop list is to sort the
     terms by collection frequency.
