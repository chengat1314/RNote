* Definition
The shortest path problem consists of determining a path p∗ ∈ P such
that f (p∗) ≤ f (q), ∀q ∈ P. In a similar way, in the k-shortest path
problem one is looking for k paths (p1 , . . . , pk ) verifying f (pi
) ≤ f (pi+1 ), 1 ≤ i < k, and f (pk ) ≤ f (q), ∀q ∈ P − {p1 , . . . ,
pk }.

* algorithm description
** Removing path algorithm
   1. remove the shortest path in the current network.
   2. determining the shortest path in the resulting network.

** Deviation path algorithm
