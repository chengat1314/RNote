** Center-based clustering algorithms
   1. K-means
   2. Gaussian expectation-maximization.


* Extending KMeans.
** Gaussian-means.[fn:1]
*** Complexity: O(k) times that of k-means.


* Use of Clustering
  Clustering algorithms are useful tools for data mining, compression,
  probability density estimation, etc.
