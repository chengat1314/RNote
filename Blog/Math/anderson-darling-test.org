#+TITLE:   Anderson Darling test
#+AUTHOR: Richard Wong

* intro
  It is a modification of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test and gives
  more weight to the tails than does the K-S test.

* Use
  to test if a sample of data came from a population with a specific
  distribution.

* tables of critical values available:
  1. normal.
  2. lognormal.
  3. exponential.
  4. Weibull
  5. extreme value type I.
  6. Logistic distributions.

* Compare with K-S test
  - The K-S test is distribution free in the sense that the critical
    values do not depend on the specific distribution being tested.
  - The Anderson-Darling test makes use of the specific distribution
    in calculating critical values.

* Conclusion:
  The Anderson-Darling test is an alternative to the chi-square and
  Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit tests.
