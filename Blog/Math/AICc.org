* Intro
  * In instances where the sample size is large and the dimension of
    the candidate model is relatively small, AIC serves as an
    approximately unbiased estimator of the Kullback discrepancy.
  * In other settings, AIC may be characterized by a large negative
    bias, which limits its effectiveness as a model selection
    ceriterion.
  * The negative biasd of AIC arises when the penalty term of the
    criterion, which is justified asymptotically, provides an
    inadequate approximation to the bias adjustment it is designed to
    estimate.
  * In small-sample applications, better estimators of the bias
    adjustment are available.

* Bias Investigation of AIC:
  AIC provides us with an approximately unbiased estimator of
