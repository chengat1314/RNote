** Reset Forgotten MySQL Root Password

  Have you ever forgotten the root password on one of your MySQL
  servers? No? Well maybe Iâ€™m not as perfect as you. This is a quick
  h00tow (how to) reset your MySQL root password. It does require root
  access on your server. If you have forgotten that password wait for
  another article. Original article posted on reset mysql root
  password.

  First things first. Log in as root and stop the mysql daemon. Now
  lets start up the mysql daemon and skip the grant tables which store
  the passwords.


  You should see mysqld start up successfully. If not, well you have
  bigger issues. Now you should be able to connect to mysql without a
  password.
#+begin_src shell
  mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables
  mysql --user=root mysql
  update user set Password=PASSWORD('new-password') where user='root';
  flush privileges;
  exit;
  mysqladmin -uroot - p shutdown
#+end_src
