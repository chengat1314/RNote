  * Sit in a comfortable, alert posture, with a straight back.
  * Close your eyes, and focus your awareness on your breath.

    of the exhale, and the brief pause at the bottom.
  * Keep your mind focused on the breath.
  * You may find yourself thinking about some topic or carrying on a
    conversation with yourself.

* Sheep dip training doesn't work:
  1. Learning isn't done to you; it's something you do.
  2. Mastering knowledge alone, without experience, isn't effective.
  3. A random approach, without goals and feedback, tends to give
     random results.

* SMART
  1. Specific
  2. Measurable.
     You just have to see two or three feet ahead of you.
  3. Achievable.
     A goal or objective that you cannot attain is not a target; it's
     just a maddening, soul-sucking frustration.
  4. Relevant.
  5. Time-boxed.
