* Quick Tips
** Work with one person in L-mode, one in R-mode.
** Feel R-mode with a Cognitive Shift.
** Many ideas are not verbalizable.
** R-mode can be invited not commanded.

* Morning tip:
  The first thing in the morning, you're not really as awake as you
  think. Your unconscious still has a prominent role to play. You have
  a pretty good line direct to your R-mode, at least for a little
  while.
