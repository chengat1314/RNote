* No Expertise without Experience.

* The model is a tool, not a mirror.
  
* A hard work it is:
  * You need a well-defined task.
  * The task needs to be appropriately difficult -- chanllenging but doable.
  * The environment needs to supply informative feedback that you can
    act on.
  * It should also provide oppoetunities for repetition and correction
    of errors.
    
* Here are some observations for nurse and programmers:

** Expert staff members working in the trenches aren't always recognized as experts or paid accordingly.

** Not all expert staff want to end up as managers.

** There's a huge variance in staff members' abilities.

** There's a huge variance in managers' abilities.

** Any given team likely has members at widely different skill levels and can't be treated as a homogeneous set of replaceable resources.

* 5 Dreyfus Model Stages:
  1. Novice: Novice need recipes. When something unexpected comes up,
     they will be completely flummoxed.
  2. Advanced beginners: Advanced beinners don't want the big picture.
  3. Competent: Competents can troubleshoot. But they can't apply
     agile methods the way we would like.
  4. Proficient: can self-correct.
  5. Expert: work from intuition, not from reason.
** Rules ruins Experts.
** From Novice to Expert:
*** Moving away from relience on rules to intuition.
*** A change in perception, where a problem is no longer a collection of equally relevant bits but a complete and unique whole where only certains bits are relevant.
*** Finally, a change from being a detached observer of the problem to an involved part of the system itself.
