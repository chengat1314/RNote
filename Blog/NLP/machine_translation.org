* Challenges of MT
** Lexical Ambiguity.
   [Dorr et. al 1999]

* Classical MT.
  - Rule-based Method.
  Compile bilingual languages.  
  Little analysis of the source text.

** Direct MT.
   Translation is word-by-word.

** Transfer-Based Approaches
   - Analysis
     eg: build a syntactic analysis of the source language.
   - Transfer
     Convert the source-language to dest-language.
   - Generation


* Statistical MT.
  Early 1990s IBM
