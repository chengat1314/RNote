* Fix Tips
  1. There's more to a good fix than just makeing the software behave correctly.
  2. Start from a clean source tree.
  3. diff first, commit second.
  4. Make sure you know how you're going to test it before designing
     your fix.
  5. Every occasion where we choose not to address the root cause of a
     problem, we are significantly reducing the overall quality of the
     codebase.
  6. Refactor or change functionality -- one or the other, never both.
  7. One logical change, one check-in.

* Review tips:
  1. 




* Fixing Goals:
  1. Fixing the problem.
  2. Avoiding introducing regressions.
  3. Maintaining or improving the overall quality(readability,
     architecture, test coverage, performance, and so on ) of the
     code.

* Testing sequence:
  1. Run the existing tests, and demonstrate that they pass.
  2. Add one or more new tests, or fix the existing tests, to
     demonstrate the bug.
  3. Fix the bug.
  4. Demonstrate that your fix works.
  5. Demonstrate that you haven't introduced any regressions.




* Rule of fixing bug:
  1. Don't modify the source until you have a failing test.
  2.
