* Anti-patterns:
** Priority Inflation.
   Remedies:
   1. Scrub your bugs regularly.
   2. Control bug priorities.
      Allow users to specify severity but notpriority, and have a
      well-defined process by which priorities are allocated.
   3. Switch away from numeric priorities, and keep your bugs as a
      simple list in priority order.

** Prima donnas destroy teams.
   Remedies:
   1. Ensure that "done means done".
   2. Break large tasks up into small, concrete chunks.
   3. Whoever caused a bug fixes it.(polluter pays)

** Maintenance team.
   Remedies:
   Keep one teeam from initial concept through to deployment.

** Rewrite:
   Remedies:
   1. Be very suspicious of any proposal to rewrite, take time to
      prove this to yourself.
   2. Minimiz you exposure as much as possible.(avoid big-bang)
   3. Be particularly carful to find the corner cases that the
      existing code handles correctly and that you need to replicate.
      
** Firefighting will never fix a quality problem. 
   Take the time to identify and fix the root cause.

** Ensure that your code ownership strategy is clear.

** Treat anything you don't understand as a bug.
