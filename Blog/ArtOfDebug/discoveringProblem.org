* Tracking Bugs:

** Bug-tracking system:
   1. Do not forget about a bug;
   2. By providing a standard format for bug reports.(Increases the
      chance that all relevant info will be included.)
   3. Ensures that for each release we know which bugs are outstanding.
   4. Allow prioirtize bugs and determine which to work on first.
   5. Ensures that everyone understands the current state of the bug.
   6. Provides an overview of the current state of the project.
   7. We can store the reasoning behind a decision that we choose
      not to fix a bug.
** Good bug report:
   
*** A report should be sepcific, unambiguous, and detailed, but also minimal and unique.

*** Environment and Configuration Reporting:
    Collect environment and confiuration information automatically.

*** Tips:
   If you're working in a small colocated team, don't have many bugs
   to track, and don't need to provide remote access to your bug
   database, then a nontechnical solution may well be right for you.

* Working with users.
  - Make it obvious how to report a bug.
  - Automate.
  - Provide multiple options.
  - Keep it simple.
  - Don't have too rigid a template.
  - Respect your users' privacy.
  - Imagine how things might appear from your users perspective.
  - Provide feed back.
