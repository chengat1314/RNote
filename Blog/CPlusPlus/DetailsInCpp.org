* Tips

* Good habits
  1. If we cannot guarantee that the variable will be reset before
     being read, we should initialize it.
  2. in multi-comment style, Beging each line in the comment with
     asterisk, thus indicating that the entire range is part of a
     multi-line comment.
     
* Details (Something we may overlooked)

** An istream becomes invalid when we hit end-of-file or encounter an invalid input.

** Buffers:

*** Output buffers usually must be explicitly flushed to force the buffer to be written.

*** reading cin flushes cout; cout is also flushed when the program ends normally.

*** By default, writes to cerr are not buffered and clog are buffered.


* Methods

** The use a class we need to know three things:
   1. What is its name?
   2. Where is it defined?
   3. What operations does it support?
