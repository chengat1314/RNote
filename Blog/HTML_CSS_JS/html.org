* Benefits of HTML5
  1. Retains backward scompatibility with previous versions of HTML.
  2. HTML5 contains many features to facilitate the development of
     applications.
  3. The HTML5 specification contains explicit rules about parsing
     documents and error handling.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Title of the document</title>
</head>

</body>

</html>
