#+TITLE:   html5

* Jargons
  - ancestor :: when one tag contains another tag.
  - desendent :: when one tag contained by another tag.

* Tags types:
  [fn:1]
** page tags:
*** DOCTYPE
    DOCTYPE is not an HTML tag, is an XML tag.

*** <head>
    1. Contains no web content
    2. Contains the meta information
       - meta info :: information about your information.
    3. Contains the title tag.

*** <body>
    All of the visible content of a web page should be contained in
    the <body> tag.

** block tags.
   - block level tags are used to define regions on the page.
   - All visible content must be the descendent of a block-level tag.
   - block-level tags are all contained in the <body> tag which is
     one of the page tags.
   - block-level tags which expand to fill the entire width of their
     containing block.
   - You should not put a space between the name of the tag and the
     <.
   - block-level tags can contain other block-level tags.

*** p
    paragraphs.

*** h1...h6
    head tag.

*** Lists.
    - ol :: ordered list.
    - ul :: unordered list.
#+begin_src html
<ol>
  <li>  </li>
  <li>  </li>
  <li>  </li>
</ol>
#+end_src

*** div
    the <div> tag defines a group of regions on your page.

*** table

*** Forms.


** inline tags.
   - inline tags take up only as much width as does their contained contents.
   - you cannot have a block-level tag inside of an inline tag.

*** a
    anchor
    + target :: which window in which the link will be opened.
      - _self :: the same window as the link
      - _blank :: a new window.
    + href :: hypertext reference

*** em, string and span.
    + em :: text that is different or noticeable in some way.
            (/italicized/ in default.)
    + strong :: text is important in some way.
                (*bold* in default.)
    + span :: span is like div, don't make your text any different but
              can with class attribute and make up our own tags.

*** self closing tag:
    1. There is no closing tag
    2. There is a */* before the *>* to indicate that the tag is
       self-closing.

** element level tags

* Benefits of HTML5
  1. Retains backward scompatibility with previous versions of HTML.
  2. HTML5 contains many features to facilitate the development of
     applications.
  3. The HTML5 specification contains explicit rules about parsing
     documents and error handling.

* Faq:
  - Its a framework but not implementation.
  - why do we need new structural elements.




* basic structure about HTML5

  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
  <title>Title of the document</title>
  </head>

  <body>
  The content of the document......
  </body>

  </html>
