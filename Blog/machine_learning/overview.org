* Supervised learning.

** Classification
   Predict discrete valued output/attribute.

** Regression
   Predict continuous valued output/attribute.(Price, etc)

*** linear regression(one variable)
    (univarian regression)
    Hypothesis: one variable linear function.
    Choose theta0, and theta1 so that H(x) is close to y for training examples(x,y).
    - TODO: contuour figures.
* Unsupervised learning.

** clustering

* Reinforsement learning.
